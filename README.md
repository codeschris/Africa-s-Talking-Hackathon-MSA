## Team Devs


## Problem:

On the beginning of every semester, students are required to register their units. However, this is a challenge as not all the students have as to smartphones, laptops or computers.

## Solution:

We created a ussd code `(*384*57162#)` to enable university students to register their units without worrying about their type of mobile device.

## Vision:

Our vision is to see this project expand and be used by all universities in the country. We also plan to expand some of its features such as including a e-fees statement.
